        "Now that we have a model and data it's time to train, validate and test our model by optimizing its parameters on our data. Training a model is an iterative process; in each iteration (called an *epoch*) the model makes a guess about the output, calculates the error in its guess (*loss*), collects the derivatives of the error with respect to its parameters (as we saw in the module), and **optimizes** these parameters using gradient descent.
